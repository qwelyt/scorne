# scorne
A corne with extra buttons. This is a scorned keyboard.

It is basically a corne, but with three extra buttons. This makes the layout work like a Lets Split (or half of a fourtwelve) but with a thumbcluster lite Corne. It only requires one MCU though.

Parts from https://github.com/MKSwe/OpenSCAD-utils are used in this project.
